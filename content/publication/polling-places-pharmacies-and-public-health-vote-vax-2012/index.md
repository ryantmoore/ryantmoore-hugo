abstract: US national elections, which draw sizable numbers of older voters,
  take place during flu-shot season and represent an untapped opportunity for
  large-scale delivery of vaccinations. In 2012, Vote & Vax deployed a total of
  1585 clinics in 48 states; Washington, DC; Guam; Puerto Rico; and the US
  Virgin Islands. Approximately 934 clinics were located in pharmacies, and 651
  were near polling places. Polling place clinics delivered significantly more
  vaccines than did pharmacies (5710 vs 3669). The delivery of vaccines was
  estimated at 9379, and approximately 45% of the recipients identified their
  race/ethnicity as African American or Hispanic. More than half of the White
  Vote & Vax recipients and more than two thirds of the non-White recipients
  were not regular flu shot recipients.

summary: US national elections, which draw sizable numbers of older voters, take
  place during flu-shot season and represent an untapped opportunity for
  large-scale delivery of vaccinations. In 2012, Vote & Vax deployed more than
  1500 Election Day flu shot clinics in polling places and pharmacies across the
  United States. Despite pharmacy clinics being more numerous, polling place
  clinics delivered significantly more vaccines than did pharmacies.
  Approximately 45% of the recipients identified their race/ethnicity as African
  American or Hispanic. More than half of the White Vote & Vax recipients and
  more than two thirds of the non-White recipients were not regular flu shot
  recipients.
